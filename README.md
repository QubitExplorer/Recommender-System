# Recommender Systems:

Here, we will be further exploring different varieties of recommendation algorithms available today and we also going to develop new customizable model using deep learning techniques like RNN, CNN, and LSTM. Similarly, In modern days there are varieties of recommender systems available and below are the two major types:
1. Collaborative Filtering (User to User), and
2. Content Based Filtering (Product to Product).

Different Methods to identify User similarities:
1. Correlations,
2. Cosine Similarities,
3. Jaccard Similarities,
4. Euclidean Distance, (measuring straight line distances, even distance between Vienna to Dublin or Dublin to Chennai. In 3 dimensions!)
5. Hamming Distance, 
6. Manhatten Distance,
7. Bhattachryya Distance,
8. Neural Network Embeddings (Collaborative Filtering),
9. Kullback Leibler divergence,
10. Embeddings and Latent Features,
11. Sequence-Based Similarity,
12. Deep Collaborative Filtering with Embeddings (via Neural Networks),
13. Transformer Models for Sequential Recommendations (e.g., BERT4Rec), and 
14. Other Hybrid Approcahes.

Here are the few examples of companies using recommendation engines:
 1. Amazon - To suggest similar products which we likely to hit enter and buy it, today its market value around 1.97 trillion us dollers,
 2. Netflix (~322 billion USD) - where we indulge into our favorite movies without even glancing at the clock, and
 3. Spotify (~ 74 Billion USD) - Where we listen similar songs and music which we preferably fell in love with. 

Here, we will be leveraging RecBole libraries to explore various models and to develop more customizable one. Ref: https://recbole.io/
