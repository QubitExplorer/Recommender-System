# Smart Buildings & Smart Cities:

City List: Created a list of 20 major cities with their latitude and longitude coordinates.

Loop through Cities: The For loop goes through each city and calls get_weather_open_meteo, passing the latitude, longitude, and city name.

Prediction: Time series foundational models would be utilized.

** Model Approach:**

Data Collection, (Major Weather Platforms API's), Example APIs for real-time environmental data: A. OpenWeatherMap (Temperature, humidity, wind, air quality) → https://openweathermap.org/api

B. AirVisual API (CO2, PM2.5, Air Quality Index) → https://www.iqair.com/

C. SmartThings API (IoT device integration) → https://smartthings.developer.samsung.com/

D. Google's SMart Buildings: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/smart_buildings

E. CU-BEMS, smart building energy and IAQ data https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/smart_buildings

F. Smart Cities India: https://smartcities.data.gov.in/?utm_source=chatgpt.com

Data Preprocessing

A. Missing Data Handling: We can start with simple averaging, forward fill (windows lead), backward fill (windows lag), mean/average, If the goal is to improve the existing model (utilizing inferential statistics includes Probability, Uncertainty, Correlations etc.,), for alternative or for more missing data advanced models (Transformers, LSTM, GANs and xLSTM) for highly non linear data.

Feature Engineering, (Functions to create/select different variables like Temperature, Humidity, CO2, PM2.5, VOCs, Noise, wind speed, carbon emissions, Oxygen, Light Levels, Air flow, thermal, vibrations and lot more.,)

Model Selection (Models like ARIMA, RNN, LSTM, Transformers can be leveraged), A. Weights Normalization, standardizations.(Min-Max Scalling, z-Scoring etc.,)

Evaluation Metrics (Mean Square Error, etc),
Results Interpretation, and
Optionally, flat maps will be implemented for better visualization.
Potential Advantages or Benefits Estimation for Smart Buildings:

A. Predictive Maintenance = No Surprise Breakdowns,

B. Environmental Impact,

C. Higher Asset Value & Tenant Attraction,

D. Carbon Emission, Energy Optimization and Savings,

E. Integration with Renewable energy, and

F. Smarter Construction, Reduced Operational Waste, and Energy Efficient Buildings.

G. Cleaner Indoor Air = Healthier Humans

H. Lower Utility Bills = Instant Payback

I. Carbon Taxes or Regulations

J. Attracting Talents, or workforce to a modern buildings.

K. Operational Efficiency Without More Staff

L. Better ROI Over Time (Better resale value)

M. AI climate models, part of smart cities. I.e. Integration

N. Customer Satisfaction

O. Grid Independence & Energy Resilience (I.e During Grid Downtimes due to natural disasters, energy downtime etc.,)

P. Investing for Future

General Value Prop: Smart Buildings transform spaces into intelligent, responsive environments — cutting energy waste, boosting occupant comfort, and unlocking real-time insights for better decisions — all while reducing carbon emissions and operating costs.

Reports for reference: IEA International Energy Agency | OECD Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development

According to the IEA, buildings are responsible for nearly 40% of global energy-related CO₂ emissions. That’s MASSIVE. Climate Change!
